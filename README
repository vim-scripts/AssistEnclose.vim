[ Usage ] 

___________ 
    1. Enclosing 


On text 

<Alt>  +      ) ( 

text    	→    (text) 



visual block on 'some text' and <Alt> + )(   on text 

some text      →   (some text) 


with the same way working on 

[...] <...> {....} 

<Alt> +  ][  or  ><  or  }{   

to make each enclosing. 


Basically, enclosing range is in the unit of word, 
so you don't need care about cursor position precisely. 
Regardless of input mode(normal or visual), 
put on across somewhere of the word you want. 




When to make enclosure with single or double quotations 

             '...'           "..." 

<Alt> +         ';      or      ": 

(this is to make consistency with other key mapping) 



(example) 

stdio.h 

"stdio.h" 

<"stdio.h"> 


<...> {...} [...] (...) eat over single or double quotations '...' "..." 


In (vertical)visual mode (<C-v>)

by pressing <leader> key before same key operation,
you can encapsulate 'on each word'.

w◘rd
w◘rd
w◘rd

(word)
(word)
(word)

    2. Delete contents in enclosure 


On the word enclosed with (...) 

<Alt> + (( 

Same way is applied to   

             {...}   [...]   <...>   "..."   '...' 

<Alt> +      {{      [[      <<      ::      ;;      on each 




___________________________________ 
    3. Delete enclosure leaving contents intact 


On the word enclosed with (...) 

<Alt> + )) 

Same way is applied to   

           {...}   [...]   <...>   "..."   '...' 

<Alt> +    }}      ]]      >>      ""      ''          on each 




________________________________________ 
    4. Blow out the contents at once in the enclosure 


hit <A-;'> to blow out in '...' or "..." 

hit <A-[]> to blow out in [...] <...> {...} (...) 


You can also rearrange "priority order" by modifying g:ListBraTotal 

Default order is  {...}	  ­  (...)   ­ <...>  	­   [...] 

                   ←                                      → 
                   High                                   Low

word -> \emph{word}         when in .tex 

with Alt + ][

This function is separated to easy-through-pairing.vim
for functional rearrangement.
